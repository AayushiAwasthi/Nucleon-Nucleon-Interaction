# Nucleon-Nucleon-Interaction

This repository provides a Python implementation for solving the nucleon-nucleon (NN) phase shifts using a 5th-order numerical method. The approach involves solving the phase equation and extracting the neutron-proton (n-p) and proton-proton (p-p) phase shifts.

**Features**
Uses the optimized model parameters of the Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential to construct the NN potential.
Solves the phase equation using a 5th-order numerical method.
Calculates neutron-proton (n-p) and proton-proton (p-p) phase shifts at different energies.
Computes the NN cross sections using the obtained n-p and p-p phase shifts at different energies
